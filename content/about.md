# About me

Hello! I'm Larissa and I'm a passionate programmer that lives a double life as a
Computer Science Graduate student and web developer in Salvador, Brazil.

During the day, I'm a researcher investigating performance in hybrid Wireless
Optical Networks, modeling networking systems and writing cool simulations to
test hypothesis. At night, I'm a back-end/front-end programmer at
[Colivre](http://www.colivre.coop.br) helping the development of a open source
web platform for social networks called
[Noosfero](http://gitlab.com/noosfero/noosfero).

I got my Bachelor degree in Computer Science almost by accident, as I wasn't
sure what it was all about when I first got in. Luckily for me, I fell in love
with it -- after all, it centers around two of the things I love the most: logic
and solving problems. During my education, I started my programming career with
C/C++, Java and PHP. I finally met Ruby and Python in 2011 and we've been
together ever since.

I'm also an enthusiast of free software since I was introduced to open source
philosophy during freshman year of college. I've been using Linux since 2009.
Recently I've started contributing to Debian project as a member of its Python
Modules Team.
