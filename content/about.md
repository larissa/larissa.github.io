# About me

Hello! I'm Larissa and I'm a passionate ruby programmer living in Edmonton,
Canada.

I got my Bachelor degree in Computer Science almost by accident. Luckily for me,
I fell in love with it -- after all, it centers around two of the things I love
the most: logic and solving problems. During my education, I started programming
with C/C++, Java, PHP and Python. I finally met Ruby in 2011 and we've been
together ever since.

Back home in Brazil I was a full-stack developer at
[Colivre](http://www.colivre.coop.br) helping the development of a open source
web platform for social networks called
[Noosfero](http://gitlab.com/noosfero/noosfero).

I have also done research in Computer Network, investigating performance in
hybrid Wireless Optical Networks, modeling network systems and writing cool
simulations.

I'm an enthusiast of free software since I was introduced to open source
philosophy during freshman year of college. I've been using Linux and
contributing to open source since 2009.
